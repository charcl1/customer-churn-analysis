# Customer Churn Analysis
This project builds a churn model using a telecom customer dataset to predict which customers are most likely to leave, so the company can focus its retention efforts on those at highest risk. The data includes information about the customer's demographics, the services they use, and whether they’ve churned.

## Workflow

**Data Preprocessing** - Encoded categorical variables and scaled numeric variables

**Model Building** - Trained and tested logistic regression model

**Evaluation** - Evaluated performance using ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and accuracy score

## Results
The model achieved 81% accuracy and a ROC-AUC of 0.85, showing that it predicts customer churn well and is ready for use.
